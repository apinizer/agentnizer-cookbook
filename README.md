# 🤖 AI Pipeline Cookbook

### A production-tested multi-agent development pipeline — anonymized from the real thing

**Local file-based state machine. 13 specialized Claude agents. One CLI command kicks the whole team off.**

*We've been running this for months on the way to building something larger. This cookbook is part of paving that road — open-sourced because the road itself is worth sharing.*

## What is this?

> **This is not a demo. We use this pipeline every working day to ship features.**

In one sentence: a **13-agent assembly line** that takes a plain-English task and turns it into a reviewed, tested, security-scanned, documented PR — end to end, no human in the loop except at two gates.

### Cookbook vs what we actually run

| Aspect | In production | In this cookbook |
|---|---|---|
| 13-agent assembly line | ✓ | ✓ |
| Parallel review fan-out (3 reviewers + tester + security) | ✓ | ✓ |
| Manifesto axes (perf / thread-safety / safety / observability) | ✓ | ✓ |
| Sprint Contract pattern | ✓ | ✓ |
| Idempotency + retry caps | ✓ | ✓ |
| Two human gates (design + QA) | ✓ | ✓ |
| **State machine** | Issue tracker — see [use-case doc](docs/use-case-tracker-driven-pipeline.md) | `.state/` filesystem |
| **Agent prompts** | Tuned to our stack and team rules | Generic, you adapt |
| **Coding conventions / pitfalls** | Baked into every prompt | Not included |
| **Learned lessons** | Months accumulated | Empty templates |

Treat this as the **working skeleton you specialize on top of**, not as a turn-key replica. Run the [quickstart](examples/quickstart/README.md) to confirm it works on your machine, then drop your real profiles in.

```bash
$ ./team.sh start "Add a health check endpoint that verifies dependencies"

Planner running...
✅ Plan created — 1 sub-task

  [1] 20260427-1432-hlt  module=<your-module>  risk=LOW  blocked_by=[]

Daemon spawned (pid 47213). Tail logs: ./team.sh logs --daemon

# ... ~15 minutes later ...

$ ./team.sh status
Daemon: RUNNING (pid 47213, uptime 0:14:22)
Active Tasks (0): (empty)
Recent Completed (last 5):
  20260427-1432-hlt  <your-module>  done  0:14:11  82k
```

That's it. One command. A reviewed, tested, security-scanned, documented PR-ready change on disk — produced by the same agent line-up we use to ship our own work, just with a local-filesystem backend instead of our tracker.

---

## Who this is for (and who it isn't)

> **This is not a beginner's tutorial. If you're new to LLM-based development pipelines, this isn't where to start — and we'd rather you knew that on line 1 than on day 3.**

**You'll feel at home here if:**
- You've already tried LangChain / CrewAI / AutoGen / LangGraph (or built your own loop) and concluded *"a single prompt does not ship features"*.
- You've shipped real software with real CI, real reviews, real on-call. You know what production-grade means and you want your AI pipeline to look like that — not like a Jupyter notebook.
- You read "13 agents in parallel against the same diff" and your first reaction was "yes, finally" — not "isn't that overkill?".
- You'd rather have a 440-line README that respects your time than a 30-second demo that hides the wires.

**Look elsewhere if:**
- You're searching for a "make me an AI agent" tutorial. This is a *system*, not an introduction.
- You want a single-prompt copy-paste solution. We tried that. It doesn't ship.
- You're doing a hackathon project. The setup ratio is wrong — adapt-then-ship beats install-and-go for production work, but a hackathon needs install-and-go.
- You expect a hosted UI, a button-click experience, or a SaaS dashboard. None of that is here.

## Why we open-sourced this

Two reasons, both honest:

**1. The patterns are useful and we'd want to read them.** Multi-agent decomposition, parallel review fan-out, manifesto-graded change, idempotent state, crash-resumable daemons — these are mechanics we figured out by running this for months. None of them are individually novel; the value is in seeing them wired together in something that actually ships work. If you're building an AI dev pipeline today, this saves you the mistakes we made.

**2. We're using this repo as a milestone marker.** We're paving a longer road. We're not ready to talk about the rest of it yet — but the cookbook is the first concrete artifact on that road, the part we can publish without leaking project specifics. If anything here resonates, you're probably the kind of person we'll want to hear from when we're ready to talk about what comes next.

> **What you get:** the working skeleton — agent roles, daemon, state machine, parallel review wiring. **What you don't get:** the deeper prompt heuristics, our internal conventions, accumulated lessons. The pipeline runs and produces real output; it just won't produce *our* output. Specialize on top.

Status state machine:

```
queued → analyzing → analyzed → designing → designed → developing → developed
       → reviewing (reviewer + tester + security in parallel)
       → reviewed | review_failed (→ developer retry, max 3)
       → qa-checking → qa_passed | qa_failed (→ developer retry, max 2)
       → documenting → documented → retrospecting → done
```

---

## Why this design?

Three things make this pipeline production-grade rather than a fancy demo:

### 1. The filesystem is the state machine

Most AI pipelines invent custom state engines, message queues, or run everything in-process. We do none of that. The whole pipeline lives in a single directory:

```
.state/
├── active.json                       # the DAG: what's queued, in flight, blocked
├── completed.jsonl                   # append-only outcome log
├── locks/team.lock                   # daemon pid; prevents two daemons
└── tasks/<task-id>/
    ├── meta.json                     # status + role_done flags + retry counts
    ├── analysis.md                   # analyst output
    ├── design.md                     # architect output (Sprint Contract)
    ├── progress.md                   # developer output
    ├── reviews/{correctness,convention,quality,security}.json
    ├── tests.md                      # tester output
    ├── qa.md                         # qa output
    ├── docs.md                       # documenter output
    └── handoffs.jsonl                # inter-agent messages
```

`meta.json.status` is the dial. `meta.json.role_done.<role>` is **idempotency**: if the daemon restarts mid-pipeline, every agent that's already finished sees its flag and exits in 50ms. Nothing re-runs. Nothing duplicates.

You can `cat meta.json` and read what the team is doing. You can `tail -f handoffs.jsonl` and watch the conversation. You can `git diff .state/` and review what the AI just decided. **No black box.**

### 2. Upstream errors compound — so upstream uses bigger models

Every downstream agent inherits the upstream agent's mistakes. The analyst wrote a wrong edge case → the architect designs against a wrong spec → the developer ships a wrong feature → the reviewer rubber-stamps it.

So we put **Opus** on the upstream and security-critical roles, **Sonnet** on the structured downstream roles. Zero Haiku — we tested; cheap models compound errors faster than they save dollars.

| Role | Model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `analyst`, `architect`, `developer`, `qa`, `security-reviewer` | Opus | Upstream errors are catastrophic; security findings need real reasoning |
| `review-correctness` | Opus | Catches the bugs that matter |
| `planner`, `reviewer`, `review-convention`, `review-quality`, `tester`, `documenter`, `retrospective` | Sonnet | Structured pattern matching; clear inputs and outputs |

### 3. Review is a 5-way fan-out, not one big reviewer

A single "review my code" prompt is a coin flip. It catches the *kind* of issue the reviewer happens to focus on first; the rest slip through. We tried it. It didn't ship.

So when the developer ships, the daemon spawns **five independent Claude subprocesses at the same time** against the same diff:

- **`review-correctness`** (Opus) — bugs, missing edge cases, BS coverage
- **`review-convention`** (Sonnet) — lint / format / style violations
- **`review-quality`** (Sonnet) — DRY, SRP, complexity, dead code
- **`tester`** (Sonnet) — runs the actual test suite
- **`security-reviewer`** (Opus) — OWASP + module-specific checks

They don't talk to each other — that's deliberate. No groupthink, no *"the first reviewer said it's fine, I'll skip"*. An orchestrator (`reviewer`) waits for all five, aggregates the verdict, and either passes the task to QA or hands it back to the developer with the blocking findings.

    classDef next fill:#dcfce7,stroke:#16a34a,color:#000
    class RC,RV,RQ,T,S parallel
    class Agg merge
    class QA next
```

What this looks like on disk while it's running — five rows in `team.sh status`, same task ID, five different OWNERs:

```
Active Tasks (1):
ID                       MODULE      STATUS      OWNER                UPTIME

20260427-1432-hlt        backend     reviewing   security_reviewer    0:01:23
```

## Setup

Three commands to get the team on your machine:

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/apinizer/agentnizer-cookbook
cd agentnizer-cookbook

# 2. Install Claude Code (if you don't have it)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# 3. Drop in the demo profile (build/test/lint are harmless `echo` calls,
#    so the pipeline can run end-to-end without you wiring up a real toolchain)
cp examples/quickstart/profiles/demo.yaml .claude/profiles/demo.yaml
```

Optional: `cp .claude/.env.example .claude/.env` if you want Slack notifications. The pipeline runs fine without Slack.

---

## Run your first task

```bash
# Hand the team a tiny task
./team.sh start "$(cat examples/quickstart/task.txt)"

# In another shell, watch it work
watch -n 2 ./team.sh status
```

When the daemon goes idle (`Daemon: STOPPED`), inspect what it produced:

```bash
ls .state/tasks/*/
cat .state/tasks/*/design.md          # the Sprint Contract
cat .state/tasks/*/reviews/*.json     # the verdicts
```

If those files exist with sane content, **the pipeline works on your box**. Full walkthrough + reference output + troubleshooting in [`examples/quickstart/README.md`](examples/quickstart/README.md).

### Daemon controls

```bash
./team.sh status           # active tasks + recent completed
./team.sh logs --daemon    # tail the daemon log
./team.sh pause            # finish in-flight agents, no new spawns
./team.sh resume           # resume spawning
./team.sh stop             # SIGTERM the daemon (graceful 30s, then SIGKILL)
./team.sh resume-daemon    # restart after a crash — role_done flags pick up where it left off
```

### Then adapt to your real project

Once the demo passes, replace the example profiles with ones for your real modules:

```bash
# Use .claude/profiles/backend.yaml / worker.yaml / shared.yaml as templates
$EDITOR .claude/profiles/<your-module>.yaml

# Hand the team a real task in your repo
./team.sh start "<your real task description>"
```

See [`.claude/profiles/README.md`](.claude/profiles/README.md) for what each profile field does and how to tune it for your stack.

## Production adaptations

The cookbook ships a fully local example because it's the simplest thing that actually works. But the architecture has clean seams for production scaling. **None of this is required to run the cookbook**, but here's how to extend it:

### Make a tracker (Jira / Linear / GitHub Issues / ...) the state machine

Short version:

```
issue.status              ↔ meta.json.status
issue.labels              ↔ meta.json.role_done flags (e.g. "ai-developed")
issue.comments            ↔ analysis.md / design.md / progress.md (one comment per agent)
custom field "module"     ↔ meta.json.module
```

**The daemon's poll loop becomes a tracker poll.** Instead of reading `active.json`, query the tracker for *"open issues with label `ai-pipeline` whose status is one I handle"*. Instead of writing files, post comments and transition statuses. Agent prompts don't change — they still read structured input, write structured output.

For the long version — a full diagrammed reference of what a tracker-driven shape *can* look like (status flow, decomposition, retry loops, run modes, the parts we're deliberately *not* showing) — see:

> 📄 **[`docs/use-case-tracker-driven-pipeline.md`](docs/use-case-tracker-driven-pipeline.md)**

That document is a sketched composite, not a working module. Read its disclaimer first.

### Use Slack for action-required gates

The local example sends Slack messages only on critical events (security alert, retry-limit, task failure) — `notify-slack.py` is a fire-and-forget hook called from the daemon. In production, you can dial it up:

- **Design Gate**: after the architect writes `design.md`, post it to Slack with a *"reply 👍 to approve, ❌ + reason to reject"* prompt. Pause the pipeline; resume when the human replies. The daemon polls `meta.json.gates.design = "approved" | "rejected"`.
- **QA Gate**: after the developer ships, ping the on-call human with the diff. Same approve/reject pattern.
- **Security alerts**: keep these unconditional, even in dev — a CRITICAL OWASP finding shouldn't wait for someone to look at a dashboard.

The cookbook's `notify-slack.py` already supports message types for these — wire them into your gate decisions.

### Scale beyond one machine

`pipeline-daemon.py` runs one daemon per repo. To scale:
- Move `.state/` to NFS or S3-FUSE so multiple daemons share state.
- Use a database (Postgres + `SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`) instead of `active.json` for the queue.
- Lift the daemon's `acquire_lock()` to a distributed lock (Postgres advisory lock, Redis SETNX, ZooKeeper).

The agent prompts still don't change.

---

## A note on benchmarks (we don't have them yet, on purpose)

You'll notice this README claims "production-grade" without a single number. That's deliberate.

We've recently started running this at scale; we don't have a long-enough baseline to publish honest averages, and the metrics that matter (retry rate, token cost, time-to-PR) are **wildly task-dependent**. A 2-file refactor and a 6-file feature aren't the same number; a `[CRITICAL]`-risk module and a `[LOW]` module aren't the same number; a clean spec at triage and a fuzzy one aren't the same number. Averaging across them produces a figure that looks authoritative and isn't.

We'd rather wait until we have something we'd defend in a code review than ship a chart that markets well.

When we publish numbers, they'll come with the task distribution behind them, the manifesto-axis breakdown, and the retry-rate histogram — not just one bold "X% faster" headline. Until then, run the [quickstart](examples/quickstart/README.md) on your own codebase and judge with your own measurements.

---

## Real-world lessons (from running this in production)

**The single biggest lesson: triage is spec-first, and nothing ambiguous leaves it.** Everything downstream — analyst, architect, every reviewer — compounds whatever fuzziness survives the triage step. If the task description says "make login better", the analyst will write some plausible-sounding edge cases, the architect will design around them, the developer will ship them, and three reviewers will rubber-stamp it — and you'll get a "fix" you didn't want. We treat triage as the moment where a task either becomes a *spec* (concrete inputs, concrete outputs, concrete acceptance criteria, named modules, complexity classified) or it doesn't enter the pipeline at all. Tasks with `[?]` markers in the planner's output go to **Awaiting Info**, not to the analyst. The 90 seconds spent demanding clarity here saves a full developer-retry later.

**The Design Gate (when you turn it on) is the second-highest-leverage moment.** It catches the residual ambiguity that triage missed. Catching scope creep at design takes 90 seconds; catching it at QA takes a full developer-retry. Spend your human attention here.

**Retry rates are the canary.** When a module's `developer→reviewer` retry rate climbs, the architect's designs are slipping, not the developer. Retrospective dumps lessons into `learned-lessons/<module>-lessons.md`; you read this weekly and inject the patterns back into the architect prompt.

**Local-first beats Slack-first for solo work.** The team gets noisy fast in Slack — five subprocesses, three reviewers, retries. Watching `./team.sh status` in a tmux pane is calmer and gives you the exact same information.

**The DAG is real.** When you split a task with `planner` into 5 parallel sub-tasks, the daemon really does run them in parallel up to `LSD_MAX_PARALLEL_TASKS` (default 3). That's a real 3× speedup for parallelizable feature work.

**Idempotency is non-negotiable.** Every agent's first step is *"is `role_done.<me>` set? If yes, exit."* This is what makes crash-resume work. Without it, the daemon re-spawning mid-task corrupts state. Don't skip it when you write new agents.

## Adapting to your stack

The pipeline is **language and framework agnostic** — every stack-specific detail lives in `.claude/profiles/*.yaml`. To adapt:

- **Pick your stack.** Edit `profiles/*.yaml` — fill in `build`, `test`, `lint` commands for whatever your codebase uses. Update `manifest_check` with your language's idioms.
- **Pick your layout.** Update `read_allowlist` defaults in `planner.md` and the module-detection paths in `hooks/after-code-change.sh`.
- **Monorepo?** Works fine — point each profile's `build`/`test`/`lint` at the right sub-path.
- **No Slack?** Don't set the Slack env vars. `notify-slack.py` no-ops gracefully.

The agents themselves don't care what tech you use; they read the profile and run whatever command is there.

## Contributing

Found a better pattern? Built a tracker adapter? Added an agent role? See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The most useful contributions:
- **Tracker adapters** — make `pipeline-daemon.py` poll Jira / Linear / GitHub Issues instead of `.state/active.json`.
- **New agent roles** — performance-profiler, accessibility-reviewer, i18n-checker, etc.
- **Module profiles** — Go, Java, Rust, Ruby starter profiles.
- **Lessons** — `learned-lessons/*.md` patterns from your runs.

## Where this is going

The cookbook is what we run today. We're also using it as a way to **understand what the road needs**: visual orchestration, conversational composition, proper monitoring, marketplace-shaped reuse, enterprise-grade audit and tenancy. We have opinions on each of those — opinions that came from many months of actually shipping with this pipeline, not from whiteboarding.

We're not ready to talk about what we're building next. We will be, in time. For now: this is the anonymized version of how the team that's paving that road works day-to-day. If something here resonates, you're probably the kind of person we'll want to hear from when we're ready.

[Star or watch the repo](https://github.com/apinizer/agentnizer-cookbook) if you want to know when that conversation starts.
